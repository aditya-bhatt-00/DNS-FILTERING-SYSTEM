# DNS-FILTERING-SYSTEM
We made that possible‚Äîthanks to powerful ML models, real-time visualizations, and a clean UI. Trained on CIC-BELL-DNS-2021, our tool goes beyond theory and lands straight into action. 93% accuracy, zero guesswork.

# DNS Malware Detection using Ensemble Learning

A smart cybersecurity solution to detect **malicious network traffic** using **ML-powered classification** on the CIC-BELL-DNS-2021 dataset. Our model analyzes DNS records to classify traffic into **Benign, Malware, Phishing, or Spam**, and presents real-time predictions with an interactive UI and dynamic visualizations.

## üöÄ Motivation

With cyber threats becoming increasingly sophisticated, DNS remains a vulnerable vector for attackers. We aim to create an intelligent, accurate, and user-friendly detection system to flag and analyze potential DNS-based threats‚Äîturning raw logs into powerful cybersecurity insights.

## üìÅ Dataset

**Source**: CIC-BELL-DNS-2021  
- Format: CSV  
- Files: `benign.csv`, `malware.csv`, `phishing.csv`, `spam.csv`

These were merged into a unified dataset with labeled entries for ML processing.
