"Your DNS logs have secrets. We force them to confess." This isn’t just machine learning—it’s cyber interrogation. Upload your traffic, and our models (Random Forest? Nah. XGBoost + Stacking? Yes.) reveal what’s hiding: phishing, spam, or pure malware. With graphs that even your grandma would understand.
